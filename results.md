## 1. Summary

In this work several custom built and existing model architectures have been tested on the "Stanford Dogs Dataset". With increasing validation accuracy, work has progressed on different networks until a very satisfactory **53.08%** accuracy was found on the validation set using the XCeption Model with Data Augmentation and Cropped Images. 

In order to get to this accuracy several models with modified architectures, data augmentation, reshaping, cropping and modification had to be performed in order to increse the accuracy. A large 51% increase in validation accuracy was seen between the fully connected baseline NN and the final XCeption Model with Data Augmentation and Cropped Images.
